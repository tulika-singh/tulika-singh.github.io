                            <p>Our original mobile homepage was a long page with a lot of data points and charts, and the engagement on the page was low. A majority of our users skipped it and went directly to the other tabs. And the dashboard is an important page seen by every mobile user as soon as they log in. We want to improve the front door of our mobile app to better serve users’ needs. </p>

                            <h3>Our users</h3>
                            <p>Our users are busy small business owners, and they are not experts in marketing. They believed that they weren’t using Mailchimp to its fullest potential, and they wanted us to give them prioritized, personalized and achievable actions.</p>
                            <h3>Key question</h3>
                            <p>How might we surface the most relevant information to Mailchimp users on the mobile homepage?</p>
                            <h3>Scope</h3>
                            <p>Redesigning the mobile homepage and the related child pages on both iOS and Android apps.</p>
                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            <p>Starting the project, we explored the problem space by reading research documents about the original dashboard, and then we aggregated our knowledge and questions into these two columns — what we know and what we don’t know.</p>

                            <p>We then conducted interviews with our internal client success team to learn more about the best marketing practices. Here are the three most important takeaways about what users expect to see on the mobile homepage:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><span>1.</span><p><b>The most recent campaigns.</b> One of the biggest advantages of using a mobile app is that users can check their campaign performance at their fingertips. Users want to know updates about their campaigns soon after they send them.</p></li>
                                <li><span>2.</span><p><b>Ongoing campaigns.</b> Ongoing campaigns are the campaigns that are constantly active, contrary to a regular email campaign that usually lasts for 48 hours. An ongoing campaign can be an automated email, a landing page, or an ad. Since it has a much longer life span than a regular email campaign, most users often forget about the ongoing campaigns after they set them up, but they want to be reminded of the ongoing campaigns’ performances.</p></li>
                                <li><span>3.</span><p><b>Digestible and actionable data.</b> Instead of just seeing the numbers, users want to understand the “why” behind data, and how they can improve it if the performance is not ideal.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Now that we know what users want to see on the mobile homepage, we narrow down our key question to:</p>

                            <p>When we tested these three concepts, we didn’t ask users “Which one of the three versions do you like best?” Instead, we compared and evaluated each component within the three versions. And these are what we learned from the user testings — </p>

                            <p>Now we had a much clearer idea of what we wanted to include on the homepage, we moved to our next task — defining the key metrics. We used a combination of interviews and surveys for card sorting. We asked users to select their top 10 metrics and then choose 5 out of 10. After that, we compared the results and found out that the most important metrics users care about are quite common. </p>
                            <p>Both e-comm and non-e-comm users care most about the total number of subscribers, unsubscribes, open rates and click rates. The only difference is that e-comm users think that total revenue is the most important metric. </p>

                                <p>I left Mailchimp for the West Coast before this redesign was launched at the beginning of 2019. While I don't have data on the results, I believe it's achieving what it sets out to accomplish — providing users with the information they care about the most on the go. The app store rating has risen from 3.7 to an astonishing 4.8 —— Well, this is definitely not solely due to the homepage redesign, but tons of other efforts invested in the mobile app. </p>
                                <p>What I learned from the design process is that if you get your cross-functional team to care about the same thing as you do, your life is going to be so much easier. 🥰</p>
                                <p>Special thanks to Celeb Andrews (Design) and Jud Vaughan(Research). I had tons of fun working with these two talented guys. ✨ </p>
